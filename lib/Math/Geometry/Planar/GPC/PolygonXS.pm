=head1 Portability

This module successfully compiles on i386 and solaris architectures
according to the cpan testers results.  Hopefully, versions after 0.04
will work on WIN32.  I don't have any non-linux machines, so feel free
to send patches.

=head1 Changes

  0.01 - First public release.
  0.02 - Added API documentation.
  0.03 - Fix to allocation error.
         Possibly Fixed WIN32 compile problem?
  0.04 - Twiddling with WIN32 compile problem (last try)
  0.05 - Corrected license statements.

=head1 Constructors

=head2 new

Traditional constructor, returns a blessed reference to the underlying C struct. 

  use Math::Geometry::Planar::GPC::Polygon;
  my $gpc = Math::Geometry::Planar::GPC::Polygon->new();

=head2 new_gpc

An optionally imported constructor, for those of you who don't like to
type so much.

  use Math::Geometry::Planar::GPC::Polygon qw(new_gpc);
  my $gpc = new_gpc();

=cut
sub new_gpc {
	my $class = __PACKAGE__;
	return(new($class));
} # end subroutine new_gpc definition
########################################################################

=head1 Bound Functions

These are the functions provide by the Inline-C code.  See functions.c
in the source package for intimate details.

=cut
########################################################################

=head2 from_file

Loads a from a file into your gpc object.  See the GPC library
documentation for details.

  $gpc->from_file($filename, $want_hole);

=cut

=head2 to_file

Writes to a file.

  $gpc->to_file($filename, $want_hole);

=cut

=head2 clip_to

Clips the $gpc object to the $othergpc object.

$action may be any of the following:

  INTERSECT
  DIFFERENCE
  UNION

  $gpc->clip_to($othergpc, $action);

Be wary.  This interface may need to change.

=cut

=head2 add_polygon

Adds a polygon to the gpc object.  @points is a list of array references
which describe the point of the polygon.  $hole is 1 or 0 (0 to not add
a hole.)

  $gpc->add_polygon(\@points, $hole);

=cut

=head2 get_polygons

Gets the polygons from the gpc object.  I'm not sure how to tell you if
they are holes or not.  @pgons will be a list of refs to lists of refs.

  @pgons = $gpc->get_polygons();

=cut

=head1 Helper Functions

Pure-perl implementation from here down.

=head2 as_string

  $gpc->as_string();

=cut
sub as_string {
	my $self = shift;
	my @pgons = $self->get_polygons();
	my @strings;
	foreach my $pgon (@pgons) {
		# print "pgon is $pgon\n";
		# print "@$pgon\n";
		my @pts;
		foreach my $pt (@$pgon) {
